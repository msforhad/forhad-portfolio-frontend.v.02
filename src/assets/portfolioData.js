    description:"Radiant is a beautiful multi-page SaaS business template built with Tailwind CSS and Next.js, designed and built by the Tailwind CSS team. It's designed to be easy to adapt for your own project by dropping in your own app screenshots and content. Even the animated bento cards on the home page are built to be customized. The blog is powered by Sanity, so even the non-developers on your team can publish new articles. We’ve taken just as much care with the code as we have with the design, so it’s also an invaluable resource if you want to study how experts build a website with Tailwind CSS and React.",
    Built_By_Experts:'you can trust that all of the code is written following Tailwind CSS best practices, because it’s written by the same team who created and maintain the framework.',
    Built_With_NodeJs:'the template is a well-structured, thoughtfully componentized Next.js project, giving you a codebase that’s productive and enjoyable to work in.',
    JavaScript:"authored with the latest version of TypeScript by nerds who get way too much satisfaction out of getting the types just right. We also include a plain JavaScript version, just in case TypeScript isn't your thing.",
    Easy_To_Customize:'everything is styled with utility classes, directly in the markup. No configuration variables or complex CSS to wrestle with, just open the markup in your editor and change whatever you want.',
    Key_board_Accessible:'everything we build is keyboard accessible, and we carefully craft the markup to deliver the best screenreader experience we know how.',
    Production_Ready:'rigorously tested in the latest versions of all browsers to handle lots of edge-cases you might easily miss yourself',
    Simple_To_Deploy:'production-ready and easily deployed anywhere that you can deploy a Next.js application, like Vercel or Netlify.',
